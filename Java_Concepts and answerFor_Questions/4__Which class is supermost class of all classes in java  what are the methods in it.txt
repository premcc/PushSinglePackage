Methods of Object class
The Object class provides many methods. They are as follows:                                                    Method	Description

public final Class getClass()	                                                                       returns the Class class object of this object. The Class class can further be used to get the metadata of this class.
public int hashCode()	                                                                               returns the hashcode number for this object.
public boolean equals(Object obj)	                                                               compares the given object to this object.
protected Object clone() throws CloneNotSupportedException	                                       creates and returns the exact copy (clone) of this object.
public String toString()	                                                                       returns the string representation of this object.
public final void notify()	                                                                       wakes up single thread, waiting on this object's monitor.
public final void notifyAll()                                                                          wakes up all the threads, waiting on this object's monitor.
public final void wait(long timeout)throws InterruptedException                                        causes the current thread to wait for the specified milliseconds, until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method).
public final void wait(long timeout,int nanos)throws InterruptedException	causes the current thread to wait for the specified milliseconds and nanoseconds, until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method).
public final void wait()throws InterruptedException	causes the current thread to wait, until another thread notifies (invokes notify() or notifyAll() method).
protected void finalize()throws Throwable	                                                       is invoked by the garbage collector before object is being garbage collected.
