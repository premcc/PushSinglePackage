1) An ArrayList class can act as a list only because it implements List only.	 LinkedList class can act as a list and queue both because it implements List and Deque interfaces.
2) ArrayList is better for storing and accessing data.	                         LinkedList is better for manipulating data.
3) The memory location for the elements of an ArrayList is contiguous.	         The location for the elements of a linked list is not contagious.
